This is a new malware (which is unfinished), and it will have lots of cool effects. The full source code will be published soon. I will also make a yt video about it once it's finished.

Oh, and yes I did use some source codes from other gdi malwares and modify them, and made some gdi effects by myself. So credits to pankoza and everyone else.

Also it's a safety version, so you are allowed to run it on your main pc, but be careful. It contains beep sounds and epilepsy. If you are sensitive to those things, then plz do not run it and delete the files immediately.
